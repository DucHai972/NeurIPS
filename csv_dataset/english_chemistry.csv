"The reaction of sodium thiosulfate with hydrochloric acid is described by the following balanced chemical equation: $Na_2S_2O_3 + 2HCl \rightarrow 2NaCl + SO_2 + S + H_2O$
To Investigate the effect of concentration on the rate of this reaction, the experiment was carried out for a number of different concentrations of sodium thiosulfate solution. For each run, a stopwatch was started when 100 cm³ of $Na_2S_2O_3$ was mixed with 10 cm³ of 1M HCl.
