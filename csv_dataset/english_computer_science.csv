"Figure 1 shows a row of black and white discs with their position numbers shown under each square. There are only two ways to move a disc:
1. Move into an empty square one position to the left or right, for example 1 → 2 means move the disc from square 1 to square 2.
2. Jump in either direction over a single adjacent disc into an empty space immediately beyond, for example 3 → 1 means move the disc from square 3 to square 1, jumping over a disc in square 2.

Write a sequence of steps, or an algorithm, that swaps all the white discs with the black discs so that the row looks like that shown in Figure 2. You can only move a single disc in each step.

"Many fast-food restaurants have begun using interactive kiosks that allow customers to order food without having to go to a cashier. These kiosks have menu-driven interfaces.
Name **two** principles of universal design and explain how these principles could be met in the design of such systems.","Any two from the following:
*   Equitable Use - by incorporating accessibility features such as adjustable font sizes, colour contrasts, and audio feedback the design can ensure that the interface is usable by people with varying abilities.
*   Flexibility in Use - this principle could be met by providing features that allows the users to interact with the system in different ways e.g. via touch screen or voice commands.
*   Simple and Intuitive Use - this can be achieved in the design by a straightforward and intuitive menu structure with easily understandable icons and labels. Avoid unnecessary complexity to make the interface user-friendly for individuals with different levels of experience.
*   Perceptible Information - the system should communicate necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. For example, the menu and instructions on how to pay could be provided through multiple modalities, such as visual cues, text labels, and audio instructions, to cater to users with different sensory capabilities.
*   Tolerance for Error - this can be achieved by including features like confirmation dialogs, clear feedback messages, and the ability to review orders before finalising.
*   Low Physical Effort - the system should ensure that the touch interface is responsive to different levels of pressure, accommodating users with varying physical abilities. Consider alternative input methods for users who may have difficulty with touchscreens.
*   Size and Space for Approach and Use - the kiosks should be designed with varying heights to accommodate users of different statures or those using mobility aids. Ensure there's enough space for wheelchair users to approach and interact comfortably."

"Explain the meaning of the quote, shown in **Figure 5** above, in relation to online applications.","The meaning of the quote is that when a service such as social media is free, the users become a commodity for these platforms, and their attention and data are the actual products that are monetised. As users interact with social media platforms, they generate valuable data (through their preferences, behaviours etc.). This data is then collected, analysed, and used to create targeted advertising or sold to third parties for various purposes, such as market research or influencing user behaviour.

The quote serves as a reminder that even though users may not be directly paying for the service with money, they are indirectly paying with their personal information and attention."
Provide **one** implication that the quote could have for your use of online applications.,"* Privacy - users often share personal information that becomes valuable for targeted advertising.
* Manipulation of attention - excessive use of online platforms can lead to addictive usage patterns, foster a comparison culture which in turn can have a negative impact on mental health.
* Responsible use - on a positive note, the quote can serve as an educational tool, promoting digital literacy and empowering users to make informed decisions about their online activities such as reading terms and conditions."

In recent years many instances of bias have been identified in computer vision applications. Explain one method that could be used to reduce bias in these applications.,"Any one of the following:
• Diversity of images used in training datasets – ensure that the training dataset is diverse enough to represent the target population
• Equality of representation of target population in training dataset – ensure that the images used are representative of the target population
• Size of training datasets – It is likely that larger datasets will result in more accurate models with less bias than models trained using smaller datasets.
• Human in the loop e.g. ensure proper diversity of race, gender etc. in development team
• Monitoring and Bias Auditing – continually monitor the training dataset to reflect changes in society and conduct bias audits to identify and address any biases that might have inadvertently crept in.
• Any other reasonable method to reduce bias."
"In 2023 an open letter published by the Future of Life Institute requested all AI labs to immediately pause for at least six months the training of very powerful AI systems. Interestingly, while the letter was signed by many well-known academics and industry leaders, there were many notable individuals and companies who did not publicly declare their support.
Discuss the reasons for some people supporting the initiative to pause training and others not supporting the initiative.","Points for supporting the initiative:
• Ethical concerns: time is needed to make sure that AI aligns with human values and doesn't compromise principles such as privacy, accountability, and fairness.
• Jobs/Employment/Economy: the pace of current development of AI systems has the potential to put many jobs at risk and people out of work. Pausing development provides an opportunity to address the potential societal impact on employment and consider strategies such as reskilling and implementing policies to mitigate economic disparities.
• Security Risks: Advanced AI systems, if developed without sufficient safeguards, pose potential security risks. Pausing development allows time to assess and address security concerns related to the misuse of AI, such as cyber threats, hacking, and the development of AI-driven weaponry.
• Unintended Consequences: The complexity of advanced AI systems increases the risk of unintended consequences. Pausing development permits a more thorough evaluation of the potential risks and unintended outcomes, ensuring that AI is deployed responsibly and doesn't lead to unforeseen negative impacts on society.
• Existential Threat: There are some who believe that the development of highly advanced AI systems (superintelligent AI) could potentially threaten the continued existence of humanity. A pause in AI would give more time to increase public awareness through open discussions about the risks and benefits of advanced AI systems.
• Elaboration of any other reasonable point for pausing development of advanced AI systems

Points against the initiative:
• Innovation and Progress: Continued development of advanced AI fosters innovation, leading to breakthroughs in various fields, including healthcare, education, and scientific research. Pausing development could impede progress and delay the benefits that AI can bring to society.
• Societal Advancements: AI has the potential to address complex societal challenges, such as climate change, healthcare disparities, and resource management. Halting development may hinder the application of AI in finding solutions to pressing global issues.
• Competitive Disadvantage: Countries and organisations are in a race to develop and adopt AI technologies. Pausing development may result in a competitive disadvantage, with nations that continue AI advancements gaining a lead in economic, military, and technological spheres.
• Job Creation and Economic Growth: While AI may lead to job displacement in certain sectors, it also has the potential to create new jobs and stimulate economic growth. Pausing development could limit the positive economic impact of AI, affecting industries that could benefit from increased efficiency and innovation.
• Elaboration of any other reasonable point against pausing development of advanced AI systems"

State one advantage and one disadvantage of sorting a data set.,"Advantages
Binary search requires a dataset to be sorted
Sorted data can be more user friendly e.g. social media timeline sorted by date/time, product catalogue sorted by cost etc.
Sorted data can also make it easier for data analysis e.g. finding the median or quartiles of a set of data or identifying patterns/trends and outliers

Disadvantages
sorting algorithms can take time
sorting algorithms can consume valuable computational resources such as CPU and memory.
If a dataset is already sorted (or almost sorted) the time and resources spent on sorting may not provide significant benefits.
The efficiency of sorting algorithms can vary dramatically depending on the size of the input dataset, and the size of the dataset may not always be known in advance. This places a burden on designers/programmers to have a detailed understanding of the sorting algorithm being used and an awareness of the implications under all circumstances.
Once a dataset is sorted there is a cost to maintaining the dataset in a sorted state

"The algorithm takes five passes to complete the bubble sort of the integers in values.
The bubble sort algorithm has $O(n^2)$ best and worst case time complexity. Explain what this means in terms of the number of compare operations performed.","In a list of size N the bubble sort algorithm performs N passes. On each pass it will perform N-1 compare operations. This gives a total of $N^2 - N$ operations. For large N this is approximately the same as $N^2$. Hence we write $O(N^2)$.
The best-case scenario is when the input list is already sorted. The worst-case scenario is when the input list is in reverse order. In both scenarios bubble sort will also carry out the same number of comparisons.
As the number of elements increases the number of compare operations increases quadratically (by a power of 2). For example, the number of compare operations carried out by a bubble sort algorithm on a list of size 5 would be of the order of 25. If you double the size of the input list, the number of compare operations could increase by a factor of four.

"The algorithm takes five passes to complete the bubble sort of the integers in values.
Suggest one possible improvement that could be made to the algorithm that would reduce either the number of comparisons or the number of swaps required to complete the sort.","Enhancement 1 (reducing size of list by 1 on each pass)
On the 1st pass the largest item in the list is moved to the rightmost position
The 2nd pass moves the next largest item to the second last position
Each pass moves the largest item remaining to its correct position towards the end of the list
The standard algorithm continues to compare adjacent elements that are already sorted at the end (right) of the list even though they are already sorted.
The algorithm can be enhanced by preventing these unnecessary comparisons.
This can be achieved by reducing the number of adjacent compares by 1 on each pass as shown in the implementation below.

L = [50, 20, 70, 40, 60]

OR

Enhancement 2 (halting if no swaps made during any pass)
An alternative enhancement can be achieved by introducing a 'flag' to indicate whether a swap was needed on a particular pass. If no swap was performed the list is deemed to be sorted and the algorithm can end regardless of the number of passes complete e.g. if the initial list is sorted there won't be any swaps on the 1st pass. Therefore, the algorithm can be terminated.

Alex is working out her design on paper and has inserted some data into both tables as shown in Figure 7 below. For example, the first row of data in the LOANS table records the fact that Chloe borrowed Green Eggs and Ham on 20th May 2024.
Explain how the design shown in Figure 7 removes the need for the on_loan field from the BOOKS table.","The presence of a record in the LOANS table can be used to infer that a book is on loan. (Not only that, but the date the book was borrowed can also be looked up.) Therefore, there is no need to store this information in BOOKS.

Relational databases reduce the amount of data redundancy. Explain the term 'data redundancy'.","Data redundancy refers to a situation where a single piece of data (or value) is stored in more than one place in a database. It usually occurs as a result of poor design and is considered bad practice as it can lead to data inconsistencies as well as inefficiency use of storage.

"Alex is planning to use the database for a data analytics project. A data analytics project can be carried out in stages starting with a hypothesis.
Suggest two possible hypotheses Alex could use her data analytics project to test.","Any two statements from the following:
The most/least popular book is X.
The most popular time/season to borrow books is Y
A particular user demographics (e.g. age, gender, location) prefer certain types of books.
Certain books (e.g. expensive books) are more likely to be returned on time than others.
Member A is more likely to return their books in time than member B
PR campaign results in an increase in borrowing of X%
Any reasonable hypothesis presented as a statement.

"Alex is planning to use the database for a data analytics project. A data analytics project can be carried out in stages starting with a hypothesis.
Another stage in a typical analytics project is data cleaning. Name and describe two types of data errors that can be removed using data cleaning.","Any two from the following:
Missing Values: Data entries that are incomplete or entirely absent can be filled in with appropriate values or removed if they are not critical.
Duplicate Records: Repeated entries that skew analysis and statistics can be identified and eliminated to ensure each data point is unique.
Inconsistent Formatting: Variations in data formatting (e.g. date formats, capitalisation, unit measurements) can be standardised for consistency.
Outliers and Anomalies: Data points that deviate significantly from the norm can be investigated and corrected or removed if they are erroneous.
Incorrect Data Types: Values that are in the wrong format or type (e.g. text in a numerical field) can be converted to the correct type or corrected as needed.
Typographical Errors: Spelling mistakes, typographical errors, and other text inaccuracies can be corrected to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Inconsistent Categories: Categorical data that uses different labels for the same category (e.g. ""Y"" vs. ""Yes"") can be standardised to unify the categories.
Any other relevant error e.g. Invalid entries - data that do not conform to the expected rules or ranges (e.g. negative ages, future dates for past events) can be identified and corrected or removed.

For each type of error correctly identified 1 mark
