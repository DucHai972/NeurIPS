"Company Final Accounts Yeats Ltd, has an authorised capital of €1,600,000 divided into 1,000,000 ordinary shares of €1 each and 600,000 4% preference shares of €1 each. The following trial balance was extracted from its books at 31/12/2023:
The following information and instructions are to be taken into consideration:
(i) Stock at cost on 31/12/2023 was €56,900. This figure includes damaged stock
which cost €3,800 but which now has a net realisable value of 60% of cost.
(ii) The cost of delivery vans is to be written off on a straight line basis over 5 years.
A full year’s depreciation is charged in the year of acquisition and none in the year
of disposal. Delivery vans have a scrap value of 5% of the original cost.
NOTE: During the year a delivery van which had cost €40,000 in 2019 was traded in
for €10,000 against a new delivery van costing €56,000. The cheque for the net
amount of this transaction was incorrectly treated as a purchase of trading stock but
was entered correctly in the bank account. These were the only entries in the books.
(iii) It was discovered that goods had been received from a supplier on 31/12/2023 on a
‘sale or return’ basis. These goods had been entered in the books as a credit
purchase in error. The expected selling price of these goods is €5,000 which is cost
plus 25%.
(iv) Patents (incorporating 3 months investment income) are being written off over a
7-year period which commenced in 2021.
(v) The suspense figure arises as a result of an incorrect figure for debenture interest
(although the correct figure had been entered in the bank account) and discount
allowed €400 entered only in the discount account.
(vi) A new warehouse was purchased during the year for €100,000 plus VAT @13.5%.
The total amount paid to the vendor was entered in the land & buildings account.
No entry was made in the VAT account.
(vii) Buildings are to be depreciated at the rate of 2% of cost per annum (land at cost
was €200,000).
The company revalued land and buildings at €700,000 on 31/12/2023 and this has
yet to be reflected in the accounts.
(viii) The rent received was in respect of a warehouse rented out by the company for
€1,500 per month commencing on the 01/06/2023.
(ix) The Directors recommend that:
1. Provision should be made for both investment income due and debenture
interest due.
2. Provision for bad debts to be adjusted to 4% of debtors.
3. A transfer of €20,000 should be made from profit to the capital reserve.

"4. Depreciation of Fixed Assets
Cobra Trucking Ltd prepares its final accounts to 31 December each year. The
company’s policy is to depreciate its trucks on a straight line basis over 5 years.
Scrap value is estimated at 10% of the original cost of a truck.
Depreciation is charged from the date of purchase to the date of disposal.
On 01/01/2022 Cobra Trucking Ltd owned the following trucks:
Truck No. 1 purchased on 01/05/2018 for €55,000.
Truck No. 2 purchased on 01/04/2019 for €68,000.

(i) Why does a company charge depreciation in calculating profit?
(ii) Explain the term ‘useful economic life’ in relation to fixed assets","(i)
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost/value of fixed assets over their estimated
useful economic life. Depreciation is an expense in the Profit and Loss Account. Failure to
include depreciation in the final accounts causes the profit to be overstated and the net
worth to be overstated. The financial statements would not show a true and fair view of the
business.
(ii)
Useful economic life is the expected period of time during which a fixed asset remains
beneficial/useful to the business. It is essentially how long the fixed asset is expected to
contribute to generating income before it becomes obsolete or is no longer cost-effective to
use. When an asset depreciates to the point that it is no longer useful to the business, then
it is said to be past its economic life. For example, a business purchases a Motor Vehicle
which can be used for 5 years but has no scrap value at the end of the 5 years. The company
will depreciate it by 20% a year over the 5 year period. ",,,,

Advise the bank manager if a loan of €200,000, on which a rate of 9% would be charged,
should be granted to Kelly plc.
The loan is to finance the upgrade of manufacturing equipment.
Use relevant ratios, percentages and other information to support your answer.","The Bank manager would analyse the performance, state of affairs and prospects of the
company under the following headings:
Purpose[2]
The bank manager would want to know the reason for the loan which is for upgrading the
manufacturing equipmentof the company. This seems like a good reason for granting the
loan as it will improve the efficiency of the business, lower cost per unit and increase longterm profitability.
Performance
Profitability [7]
• Kelly plc is a profitable company.
• The return on capital employed in 2023 is 17.3%.
• Profitability has improved compared to 2022 when the return was 15%.
• This is well above the return from risk-free investments of 0.25% - 3.75% and the
cost of borrowing of 8%, and 9% on the new loan.
• This indicates efficient use of its resources this year.
• The earnings per share has increased from 15 cent in 2022 to 27.1 cent in 2023. This
is a positive trend and would satisfy the bank manager.
Dividend Policy [4]
• In 2023 the dividend cover is 5.89 times. (16.98% of the profits are paid out to the
ordinary shareholders).
• In 2022 the dividend cover was 2.5 times. (40% of the profits are paid out to the
ordinary shareholders).This is an improving trend.
• Bank Manager would be happy that Kelly plc is retaining profits for expansion and
future repayments of loans and interest.
State of Affairs
Liquidity [5]
• Acid test/Quick ratio in 2023 is 1.37:1.
• This means that for every €1 of short-term debt the firm has €1.37 in liquid assets to
cover that debt.
• The Acid Test Ratio in 2022 was 1.20:1. This is an improving trend and the company
is liquid.
• The ratio is above the ideal ratio of 1:1
• There should be no issue meeting interest repayments.
40
20
Gearing [9]
• Gearing ratio in 2023 is 26.95%(Debt to Capital Employed)/36.89%(Debt to Equity)
• The company is lowly geared as this is below 50%/100%(Debt to Equity).
• This means it is financed more by equity than debt and is not reliant on outside
investors.
• Gearing in 2022 was 15%, the trend is dis-improving. Goodwin plc is becoming more
reliant on debt but the company is still considerably lowly geared.
• If the new loan was granted gearing would increase to 43.1%(Debt to Capital
Employed) or 75.73%(Debt to Equity). The company would still be lowly geared so
there is no cause for concern.
• Interest cover in 2023 is 10.17 times.
• This indicates that the company has sufficient profits to pay interest payments.
• The interest cover in 2022 was 5 times, so this is an improving trend.
• With the new loan the interest cover would dis-improve to 4.06 times which is still a
very healthy cover and would indicate that the interest payments on the new loan
would be more than covered from profits.
Security [7]
• Debentures are €150,000 are secured against the fixed assets and and due for
repayment in 2027.
• Tangible Fixed assets are valued at €480,000/€530,000/€630,000.
• There is sufficient security to cover the existing debentures, however the bank
manager would like to question the depreciation policy of the business to ascertain
the real value of the fixed assets.
• The existing Tangible Fixed Assets if valued correctly could also be used as security
for the new loan (480,000 – 150,000 = 330,000) with €330,000(adequate security)
available, this more than covers the new loan of €200,000.
• Kelly plc also has investments which cost €100,000 and are now worth €120,000.
This would indicate good investment decisions by management.
Prospects
Sector [5]
The company operates in the renewable energy sector. Short term prospects are good as
the renewable energy industry is a growing industry as more people become
environmentally aware – households can receive grants for the installation of solar panels
and no VAT is charged on the installation of these panels. Long term prospects are also
encouraging as people try to move away from reliance on fossil fuels and from higher
energy bills due to volatile economic conditions.
Conclusion: [1]
• The bank manager should grant the loan as the company is profitable, liquid and has
low gearing",5_1.png,5_2.png,,

capital of €800,000 made up of 600,000 ordinary shares of €1 each and 200,000 4% preference
shares of €1 each. The firm has already issued 400,000 ordinary shares and 40,000 4% preference
shares. 
Your friend has decided to invest €20,000 in shares in Kelly plc and has asked for your advice.
They have the option of purchasing either
- ordinary shares at market value (€1.25) or
- 4% preference shares at their nominal value of €1 each.
(i) Distinguish between ordinary shares and preference shares.
(ii) Based on your analysis of the accounts of Kelly plc what advice would you give?"," (i)
The rate of Dividend is fixed for Preference shares. There is no fixed rate of dividend for
ordinary shares.
Preference shareholders do not have any voting rights for taking crucial decisions
related to the company. Ordinary shareholders have voting rights.
Preference shareholders have priority when it comes to being paid a dividend.
Ordinary Shareholders are paid a dividend if the company has enough profits to cover
the payment.
 (ii)

Purchasing €20,000 worth of Ordinary Shares in Kelly Plc would give an investor 16,000
ordinary shares in the company. On present DPS the investor would receive €736/3.68%
of a dividend. Last year they would have received €960. This could increase or decrease
in any given year. The value of the share could also increase or decrease.
Purchasing €20,000 worth of Preference shares would give a guaranteed dividend of
€800/4%. However the investor has no say in how the company is run.
I would recommend for my friend to buy the preference shares if they would like a
guaranteed return on their money but if they are prepared to take a risk, buying
ordinary shares could give them a better return on their investment. ",5_1.png,5_2.png,,

the sales manager. [4]

helps to maintain control over a business.
A favourable variance arises when actual expenses are less than budgeted expenses or
actual revenue is above the budgeted revenue figure. For example O’Neill may
negotiate a better deal from suppliers and purchase the raw materials for less than €4.
O’Neill may end up paying his employees a commission of less than 10% sales revenue
per month.",9.png,,,
