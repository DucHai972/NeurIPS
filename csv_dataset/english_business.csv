"Question 1 (C) (i) List three grounds, under which a dismissal can be deemed unfair according to the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977/2015","Union Membership
Religious or political beliefs
Race
Pregnancy
Age
Member of the Traveller Community
Sexual Orientation
Making a protected disclosure/whistle-blowing
Legal proceeding against an employer
Availing of rights such as maternity leave, adoptive leave etc
Unfair selection for redundancy"
Question 1 (C) (ii) Outline three procedures an employer should follow when dismissing an employee under the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977/2015,"Informal Counselling.
This pre-disciplinary procedure should be carried out to ensure the employee knows the standards expected, and should be carried out by a supervisor/manager. They are made aware of the consequences if they do not meet these standards. If this informal counselling does not bring about the required improvement the formal disciplinary procedure will be invoked.

Formal Verbal Warning
This would involve a meeting with the employee at which the employee could bring a colleague or other representative. At the meeting the employee should be advised of what the problem is and invited to respond and explain his actions. Following the meeting a confirmatory letter should be given to the employee. This letter confirms that the employee has been given a verbal/oral warning, it should also contain the improvements required of the employee in respect of the behaviour which led to the warning and the timeframe within which the improvement must be made.

First Written Warning
If there is no change to the situation, a formal written warning follows the oral warning. A copy will be given to the employee’s representative. This may be followed by a final written warning, suspension without pay, transfer to another task, or section of the enterprise, demotion, some other appropriate disciplinary action short of dismissal and finally dismissal.

Second Written Warning
If the required improvement is not forthcoming within the 3-month period after the 1st written warning then a 2nd written warning may be issued. This is entirely a matter for the employer and it is common for many employers to only issue a 1st and final written warning

Final Written Warning
This warning letter will be the final one prior to dismissal so it is important that it is well drafted as it will be scrutinised closely by the employee and probably his legal advisor. This letter should only refer to the matters which have been the subject of the disciplinary procedure to date, not other matters which have never been put to the employee.

Suspension
The employee is asked not to attend work or engage in any work but will be paid pending a further investigation

Right of Appeal
The employee has the right to a fair and impartial determination of the issues concerned, taking into account any representations made by, or on behalf of, the employee and any other relevant or appropriate evidence, factors or circumstances.
====
In the case of Gross Misconduct the following procedures may apply:

Suspension
The employee is on paid leave pending the outcome on an investigation.

Investigation
A hearing or investigation is carried out. The employee is entitled to representation.

Sanction and Appeal
Following the hearing, an employee may be sanctioned and can appeal any decision. They can also take legal action to pause the process."

Utmost Good Faith
Indemnity
Insurable Interest

Utmost good faith:
A person must reveal all material facts when applying for insurance and be truthful in their application for insurance. Proposal forms must be completed accurately.

Insurable Interest: The insured must gain from the existence of the exposure unit and suffer from its loss. You can insure your own car but not your neighbours. In essence you can’t insure something unless you have a vested interest in it.
