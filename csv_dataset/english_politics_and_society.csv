"Document A: Taking Stock of Women’s Representation in Politics Across Europe ‐ A Study by the 
European Women’s Lobby, March 2023.
This research was carried out by the European Women’s Lobby (EWL) with the
support of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (WSGR). Its purpose is to map out the
current state of women’s representation in politics across Europe. The information
gathered in this document comes from desk‐based research. It also stems from
the EWL members’ contributions collected through a digital survey in 2022 across
20 European countries.
As of February 2023, Ireland ranked 101st in the world for women’s representation in national
parliaments, falling behind countries such as China and Iraq. When the Dáil celebrated its
centenary in 2019, just 114 women had been elected to it since 1918 compared with 1,190 men.
Following the most recent national election (2020), this was 130 women versus 1,211 men (10%
versus 90%).
In the twelve general elections in Ireland prior to the 2012 Act (1973‐2011) and the introduction of
quotas, the proportion of women’s representation in the Dáil never rose above 15%.
There are no quotas for local elections in Ireland. Representation of women at local authority level
across the country has risen from 12% in 1991 to just 24% in 2019. Only eight women were elected as
mayors in June 2022 (25.8%).
A recent report noted that data from the last six local elections suggest that there is no electoral
bias against women, but not enough women appear on the ballot papers. It also notes that women
are more likely to win a national seat than men if they have served in local government. To drive
gender equality in national politics, gender equality at a local level thus needs to be prioritised.
To advance gender equality in politics, in June 2021, members of the Citizens’ Assembly recommended
that the government introduce measures such as maternity leave for all elected representatives,
extend party quotas to local, Seanad, and European elections and increase sanctions for noncompliant
parties. These suggestions have not yet been enacted by the current government.
In Ireland, women running for election are more likely to be the victims of personalised, misogynistic
violence, with women facing up to eight times the level of online violence compared to their male
counterparts. A qualitative study undertaken by NUI Galway’s Journalism and Communications unit
in 2020 found that 96% of current and former women politicians, at national and local level, have
received social media or email messages that used threatening or hateful language, while three
quarters report being threatened with physical violence via online or social media.

This group organises training programmes, events and mentoring supports, that have
helped get hundreds of women elected to local and national government.

The dashboard below from our Data Hub presents women candidates across political parties*
(2020). In 2012, the Oireachtas adopted a law obliging political parties to select at least 30%
women candidates and 30% men candidates to contest general elections. From 2023 onwards,
this gender quota threshold increased to 40%. If the quota is not met, political parties will lose
50% of the State funding they receive on an annual basis to run their operations.
The Data Hub is a comprehensive store of statistical data, organised to provide you with
unique insights into the state of gender equality here in Ireland. With this powerful
resource at your fingertips, you can make informed decisions, drive meaningful change,
and contribute to a more equitable future for all. Engage with the data, share the insights,
and ignite conversations about gender equality. Remember, knowledge is power, but only
when shared and acted upon.
* Only displays information for the seven political parties that qualified for Exchequer funding under the Electoral Act 1997.
Gender Quotas in Politics in Ireland 
Since 1992 there has been an increase in both the number of women selected as candidates (from
18.5% in 1992 to 30.7% in 2020) and elected TDs (from 12% in 1992 to 22.5% in 2020).
The quota system challenges political parties to develop a culture and selection process that will
encourage women to come forward for election. It is also the responsibility of political parties to
select women in winnable seats if the true objective of the quota is to be achieved – that is,
improved gender balance in Irish politics. There are currently no quotas in place for Local Elections
(where many politicians begin their political journey), or for the Seanad.The issue of quotas in politics
is one which causes much discussion – some people do not like quotas, but we like what they do,
that is, introduce a short, sharp shock to the political system that makes change happen quickly

This research was carried out by the European Women’s Lobby (EWL) with the
support of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati (WSGR). Its purpose is to map out the
current state of women’s representation in politics across Europe. The information
gathered in this document comes from desk‐based research. It also stems from
the EWL members’ contributions collected through a digital survey in 2022 across
20 European countries.
As of February 2023, Ireland ranked 101st in the world for women’s representation in national
parliaments, falling behind countries such as China and Iraq. When the Dáil celebrated its
centenary in 2019, just 114 women had been elected to it since 1918 compared with 1,190 men.
Following the most recent national election (2020), this was 130 women versus 1,211 men (10%
versus 90%).
In the twelve general elections in Ireland prior to the 2012 Act (1973‐2011) and the introduction of
quotas, the proportion of women’s representation in the Dáil never rose above 15%.
There are no quotas for local elections in Ireland. Representation of women at local authority level
across the country has risen from 12% in 1991 to just 24% in 2019. Only eight women were elected as
mayors in June 2022 (25.8%).
A recent report noted that data from the last six local elections suggest that there is no electoral
bias against women, but not enough women appear on the ballot papers. It also notes that women
are more likely to win a national seat than men if they have served in local government. To drive
gender equality in national politics, gender equality at a local level thus needs to be prioritised.
To advance gender equality in politics, in June 2021, members of the Citizens’ Assembly recommended
that the government introduce measures such as maternity leave for all elected representatives,
extend party quotas to local, Seanad, and European elections and increase sanctions for noncompliant
parties. These suggestions have not yet been enacted by the current government.
In Ireland, women running for election are more likely to be the victims of personalised, misogynistic
violence, with women facing up to eight times the level of online violence compared to their male
counterparts. A qualitative study undertaken by NUI Galway’s Journalism and Communications unit
in 2020 found that 96% of current and former women politicians, at national and local level, have
received social media or email messages that used threatening or hateful language, while three
quarters report being threatened with physical violence via online or social media.

Document B: Web page from Women for Election.
This group organises training programmes, events and mentoring supports, that have
helped get hundreds of women elected to local and national government.
This site is a collaboration between Women for Election Ireland and the All‐Island Research
Observatory (AIRO) at Maynooth University Social Science Institute (MUSSI) and the Department
of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH). Funding for this project was awarded by the
Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).
The dashboard below from our Data Hub presents women candidates across political parties*
(2020). In 2012, the Oireachtas adopted a law obliging political parties to select at least 30%
women candidates and 30% men candidates to contest general elections. From 2023 onwards,
this gender quota threshold increased to 40%. If the quota is not met, political parties will lose
50% of the State funding they receive on an annual basis to run their operations.
The Data Hub is a comprehensive store of statistical data, organised to provide you with
unique insights into the state of gender equality here in Ireland. With this powerful
resource at your fingertips, you can make informed decisions, drive meaningful change,
and contribute to a more equitable future for all. Engage with the data, share the insights,
and ignite conversations about gender equality. Remember, knowledge is power, but only
when shared and acted upon.

Gender Quotas in Politics in Ireland 
Since 1992 there has been an increase in both the number of women selected as candidates (from
18.5% in 1992 to 30.7% in 2020) and elected TDs (from 12% in 1992 to 22.5% in 2020).
The quota system challenges political parties to develop a culture and selection process that will
encourage women to come forward for election. It is also the responsibility of political parties to
select women in winnable seats if the true objective of the quota is to be achieved – that is,
improved gender balance in Irish politics. There are currently no quotas in place for Local Elections
(where many politicians begin their political journey), or for the Seanad.The issue of quotas in politics
is one which causes much discussion – some people do not like quotas, but we like what they do,
that is, introduce a short, sharp shock to the political system that makes change happen quickly

Drawing on both documents, discuss the barriers and challenges facing women who wish to pursue a career in politics and represent their communities at local, national or European level.","Very good answer 16 - 20M independent, insightful discussion using both documents
