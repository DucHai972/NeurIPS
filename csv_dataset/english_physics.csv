"John Tyndall ranks as one of Ireland’s most successful scientists and educators.  He reached the pinnacle of 19th century science and counted amongst his friends and collaborators many of the best-known scientists of that century.  Tyndall’s scientific interests spanned heat, sound, light and environmental phenomena. Amongst his many achievements, perhaps he is best known for the explanation of why the sky is blue – the scattering of light by small particles suspended in the atmosphere.  Blue light is scattered more than other colours because it travels at shorter wavelengths.  This colour is known as Tyndall Blue. His major scientific interest was the study of the interaction of light with matter, especially gases.  He studied the absorption of infrared radiation by gases found in the atmosphere.  He made the first studies of atmospheric pollution in London.

The refractive index of a medium varies for different wavelengths of light.  Therefore, different colours travel at different speeds and are turned through different angles.
The refractive index of a block of glass for red light is 1.51 and for violet light is 1.53.
Calculate the difference between the speed of the red light and the speed of the violet light as they travel through the block of glass.","$n = \frac{c}{v}$ [3]
$c_{red} = 1.985 \times 10^8$ (m s$^{-1}$), $c_{violet} = 1.959 \times 10^8$ (m s$^{-1}$) [2+1]
difference $= 2.6 \times 10^6$ m s$^{-1}$ [2]"
