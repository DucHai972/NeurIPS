According to document A, what had been discovered by the Soviet authorities?

- Document A -
Ivan Maisky was the Soviet ambassador to London, 1932-1943. In this edited extract from his diary, Maisky writes about a visit to his embassy by Russian sympathisers, George and Margaret Cole, 17 December 1934.
I invited the Coles over today and had a serious talk with them about British protests against the secret trials and death sentences taking place in Russia. They were highly agitated. Mrs. Cole’s hands trembled nervously. I gave them a serious ticking off. I told them that, over the last three or four months, the Soviet authorities had established the existence of a large terrorist conspiracy against our Party leaders, beginning with Comrade Stalin.
The conspiracy is being organised by the German Nazis. The agents are anti-Soviet exiles who cross our borders and make contact with conspirators who are Soviet citizens. Recent months have seen a series of attempts on the life of Comrade Stalin and other leaders. The death of Kirov was striking proof of the terrorist threat.
The Soviet government had no choice but to take tough measures against the plotters. It is a hard and unpleasant thing to shoot 80-100 people, but it is better than risking the lives of millions on the battlefield. The Coles did not object, although they were still troubled by the trials and executions. I reassured them that the measures taken against the terrorists were an exceptional response to exceptional circumstances.

Hugh Dalton was a Labour politician in England and also a Russian sympathiser. This is an edited extract from his diary, in which he writes about a visit to Ambassador Maisky, 24 June 1937, during which Stalin’s show trials were discussed.
I saw Maisky alone, as I generally do, but there was probably an unseen listener to our conversation. I began by saying ‘a lot of things have been happening in your country which have disturbed us a great deal, such as the recent purge of military personnel. I should like some information about it. I hope the executions have not seriously weakened the Red Army’.
He offered a long explanation of the recent trials and executions. He said the generals were pro-German, anti-French and anti-British. They were plotting a military dictatorship in Russia, the return of capitalism and close friendship with Germany. They proposed the transfer to Germany of part of Ukraine, in return for the re-absorption of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet Union. They were willing to let Germany have a free hand in western Europe.
I said I found the story about giving up part of Ukraine almost incredible. He said I must remember the immense area of the Soviet Union. I might think that the analogy was for England to give Scotland to Germany. In fact, the analogy was rather to give up Trinidad. I told him that I still did not find this part of the story convincing.

• The Coles are “highly agitated” and Mrs. Cole’s hands “trembled nervously”,

various justifications for the executions. 
• They need “reassurance” from Maisky that these events are “exceptional”. 
• In document B, Hugh Dalton is also a “Russian sympathiser” who wants 
Russia to do well. He has been “disturbed… a great deal” by events in Russia. 
• Dalton is worried that the executions have “seriously weakened the Red 
Army”. 
• Maisky offers Dalton a “long explanation” of the trials and executions, which 
suggests that Dalton was not easily persuaded that all was well in the USSR. 
• Dalton finds part of Maisky’s explanation “almost incredible” and “not… 
convincing” which suggests he is still worried even after Maisky’s long 
explanation.

Answers may include positive and/or negative points such as:
*   Maiskyâ€™s diary is a primary source which gives historians an insight into how a loyal supporter of Stalin represented his country and explained events to the world. However, Maiskyâ€™s views of events are biased in favour of the Soviet authorities.
*   A diary deals with current events. A historian would find this diary useful as it reveals Maiskyâ€™s reactions to ongoing developments during the 1930s. Maisky believes the assassination of Kirov (which happened about a fortnight earlier) is â€œstriking proof of the terrorist threatâ€. He sees the executions as â€œbetter than risking the lives of millions on the battlefieldâ€. However, a diary does not provide a long-term perspective from which to evaluate events.
*   A diary is usually written as a private document giving the writerâ€™s honest views of events. A historian could compare Maiskyâ€™s public and private statements to illustrate the extent to which his public and private views matched each other.
*   A diary provides a historian with insight into the writerâ€™s personality and can be more interesting to read than official documents of the era. Maisky portrays the Coles as nervous dupes and seems to enjoy giving them â€œa serious ticking offâ€.
*   However, a diary gives only one perspective on events, which can be quite limited. It is likely that this diary was not completely truthful as Maisky would have been well aware of how dangerous it was to be suspected of disloyalty to Stalin. His job in London kept him away from the centre of power in Moscow and limited his knowledge of the Soviet leadership.

Answers may include points such as the following:
*   The candidate may attempt to define the term propaganda, which is the organised or deliberate spreading of information designed to persuade its audience of a particular point of view.
*   Maisky is trying to persuade the Coles and Hugh Dalton that the secret trials and executions in 1930s Russia are reasonable and unobjectionable.
*   Maisky is skilful in creating a sense of menace that threatens not only the Soviet leadership and state but also the peace of Europe. He blames the German Nazis in both documents.
*   He uses terms such as â€œlarge terrorist conspiracyâ€ and â€œplotting a military dictatorshipâ€ to frighten his audience.
*   He uses real events, such as the death of Kirov, as â€œproofâ€ of the plot against the Soviet Union. He explains the aims and actions of the plotters in some detail.
*   He attempts to forestall criticism of the executions by suggesting it was â€œhard and unpleasantâ€ to shoot the plotters, and by comparing these 80-100 deaths to â€œmillionsâ€ of deaths on the battlefieldâ€.

He offered a long explanation of the recent trials and executions. He said the generals were pro-German, anti-French and anti-British. They were plotting a military dictatorship in Russia, the return of capitalism and close friendship with Germany. They proposed the transfer to Germany of part of Ukraine, in return for the re-absorption of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet Union. They were willing to let Germany have a free hand in western Europe.
I said I found the story about giving up part of Ukraine almost incredible. He said I must remember the immense area of the Soviet Union. I might think that the analogy was for England to give Scotland to Germany. In fact, the analogy was rather to give up Trinidad. I told him that I still did not find this part of the story convincing.

Cumulative Mark (CM)

These marks are awarded for historical content which is accurate and relevant to the question asked.
The examiner will divide the answer into paragraphs or paragraph equivalents.
A paragraph or paragraph equivalent may be one of the following:
(i) A relevant introduction giving the background situation and/or defining the terms and explaining the approach;
(ii) An episode, phase or stage in a sequence of events;
(iii) Aspect of a topic/issue, with supporting factual references;
(iv) A point in an argument or discussion, with supporting factual references;
(v) An explanation of a concept or term, with supporting factual references;
(vi) A number of significant, relevant statements of fact, explanation or comment which, although not connected or related, can be taken together and assessed as a paragraph equivalent;
(vii) A good concluding paragraph or summation, which is not mere repetition.

(Summation which is mere repetition = max 4 marks)

Having divided the answer into paragraphs or paragraph equivalents, the examiner will award marks to each paragraph or paragraph equivalent as follows:
Excellent: 11-12 marks Outstanding piece of analysis, exposition or commentary. Clearly expressed, accurate and substantial information.
Very good: 8-10 marks Very good material, accurately and clearly expressed.
Good: 6-7 marks Worthwhile information, reasonably well expressed.
Fair: 3-5 marks Limited information/barely expressed.
Poor: 0-2 marks Trivial/irrelevant/grave errors.

Overall Evaluation (OE)

In awarding OE, the examiner will consider how well the candidate deals with the set question. The following grading table will apply:

Excellent: 14-16 marks
Very good: 11-13 marks
Good: 6-10 marks
Fair: 4-5 marks
Weak: 2-3 marks
Very weak: 0-1 marks

In awarding OE marks, the examiner should not expect answers of more than 40% in quantity compared to the answers to the longer topic questions in Sections 2 and 3. The proportion of CM to OE remains 60/40 throughout the examination paper. This principle of marking by paragraph (CM and OE) continues throughout Sections 2 and 3.",,,,
